      review: 'David got to my house on time, was a professional. He explained everything that he would do and gave a reasonable price to get the work done. And for his good customer service I also consider him doing all my maintenance of my whole yard because of it. If you need any work done to your yard, I highly suggest him. Thank you for solving all my yard issues David and appreciate the professionalism.',

      review: 'David has performed landscaping service for us for over a year and we are completely satisfied with everything he has done on our 3.5+ acre property. His work has ranged from routing (mowing, weeding, soil amendments, and cleanup) to more extensive and creative (building raised beds, installing extensive drip irrigation systems, planting about 50 stone fruit and citrus trees) and he always exceeds our expectations. He works quickly but at a high level of quality and always leaves the worksite neat and clean. He follows instructions well but also does the same high quality work when he is working independently with little/no supervision. He has our complete trust and confidence and receives our highest endorsement.',
